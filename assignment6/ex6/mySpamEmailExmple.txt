Hello Petru Potrimba,
Thank you for using iCloud to keep the most important information on your iOS devices safely stored. You have less than 25% of your free 5 GB of iCloud storage left.
For 0,99 â‚¬ a month, you can get 50 GB of storage. Get more storage.
You are using iCloud Photos and iCloud Drive to keep your photos, videos and documents safely stored in iCloud. And with iCloud Backup, you are keeping all the apps on your devices automatically backed up each night.
If you run out of iCloud storage, your new photos, videos and documents will no longer be uploaded to iCloud and your devices will stop being backed up.
Sincerely,
The iCloud Team
